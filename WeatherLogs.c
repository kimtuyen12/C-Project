/* weatherlog_t

A particular weather sensor called the WeatherJuicer 2000 TM stores a
log entry each day, representing weather activity from the
previous 24 hours. Each entry includes a:

- year :: 6 bits -- stored as the number of years since the year 2000.
- month :: 4 bits
- day :: 5 bits
- zip_code :: 16 bits
- high_temp :: in degrees Fahrenheit, stored as an 8-bit signed integer
- low_temp :: in degrees Fahrenheit, stored as 8-bit signed integer
- precipitation :: in mm. stored as a 10-bit unsigned integer.
- average_wind_speed :: 7 bits. unsigned int km/hr.

All of these are packed into a 64 bit unsigned integer in the above order.

For example, if on September 16, 2015, on Temple's main campus, which
is in zip code 19122, we have 15 mm of rain, a high temperature of 85
degrees, a low temperature of 65 degrees, and an average wind speed of
5 km/hour.

We'd store:
- year :: 2015, which is 15 years from 2000, so 001111
- month :: September, which is the 9th month, so 1001.
- day :: 16, which is 1 0000
- zip_code :: 19122 which is 0100 1010 1011 0010
- high_temp :: 85F, so 0101 0101
- low_temp :: 65F, so 0100 0001
- precipitation :: 35 mm so 00 0010 0011
- average wind speed :: 5 km/h, so 000 0101

And all would be packed into a single 64-bit unsigned integer:

00 1111 1001 10000 0100 1010 1011 0010 0101 0101 0100 0001 00 0010 0011 000 0101

OR

0011 1110 0110 0000 1001 0101 0110 0100 1010 1010 1000 0010 0001 0001 1000 0101

OR

We define this weather log as its own datatype called weatherlog_t, which
under the covers is really a 64-bit unsigned int. This is done in the line:

typedef uint64_t weatherlog_t;
